description: "The Nebuly Coat (1903), by J. Meade Falkner, is a suspense novel which\
  \ tells of the experiences of a young architect, Edward Westray, who is sent to\
  \ the remote town of Cullerne to supervise restoration work on Cullerne Minster.\
  \ He finds himself caught up in Cullerne life, and hears rumours about a mystery\
  \ surrounding the claim to the title of Lord Blandamer, whose coat of arms in the\
  \ Minster's great transept window is the nebuly coat of the title. When the new\
  \ Lord Blandamer arrives, promising to pay all the costs of the restoration, Westray\
  \ suspects that the new lord is not what he seems.\nThe Nebuly Coat includes elements\
  \ that were central interests in Falkner's life, church architecture and heraldry.\
  \ The massive Romanesque arches of Cullerne Minster recall those of Durham Cathedral\
  \ which Falkner was familiar with through his work as Honorary Librarian to the\
  \ Dean and Chapter as well as viewing it from his house on Palace Green.\n From\
  \ Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
